# AI Usage Reflection

Cite the usage by including screenshots or a link to the conversation with your AI of choice. Make sure to include any context, instructions, and all the converstations you had with the AI.

Here is the link to my conversation with AI: https://chatgpt.com/share/6909368a-d524-8001-88f8-f4247d6b6aad

Write about why you used AI. Was there a gap in knowledge you wanted to fill? Were the answers through traditional search engines not adquete? Did you want to let AI help you format something in a quick manner?

I tried doing the homework by the instructions and then asked AI to help me fix my syntax and understand the dependencies within each file.

Evaluate the AI's response. If you asked multiple questions, you can pick one of the responses the AI generated. Does the AI answer your question properly? Does it hallucinate any details? Could there be room to improve this response through manual editing? Did you accept this response fully or adapt parts of it into your work?

One example was when I asked AI was "why is node_modules still in repo even though i pushed .gitignore". I realized this is because I pushed all the node modules in the beginning, so AI answered my question by teaching me a command to revert that specific push.
